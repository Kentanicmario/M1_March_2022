# VEHICLE PARKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
# INTRODUCTION
Vehicle Parking Management System is based on the concept of generating vehicleâ€™s records & updates it. Here, the user can add Vehicle details such as Vehicle Number into the program and store it in the database. The proposed method is hassle free and less time-consuming. This System simplifies the method of storing arrival and departure information. This project is easy to operate and hassle free. This project has been built in C language as a console application without using any graphic features.
# OBJECTIVES
  * To build a system that efficiently tracks the arrival vehicles into the parking slot.
  *	To build a system that stores the number of vehicles in the parking slot.
  *	To build a system that displays the number of vehicles parked. 
  *	To build a system that efficiently tracks the departure and exit of the vehicles outside the parking slot. 
# BENEFITS
  *	It provides necessary guidelines to make the whole parking process smoother.
  *	Enhances tracking and speed of parking process thereby helps people to find the parking spots quickly.
# COST AND FEATURES
  *	The cost for implementing this project is minimal to none. Nevertheless, future enhancements to this project would effectively increase the costs.
  * Real time vehicle tracking and counting.
# DEFINING OUR SYSTEM
Once the vehicle arrives at the parking, details such as vehicle number is recorded. Now, vacancy of parking slot is checked. If the parking slot is free, then it is allotted to the vehicle. When the vehicle is moving out, the vehicle details is again asked and consequently the vehicle detail is removed from the database and thereby the slot is again free.
# SWOT ANALYSIS
## STRENGTH
  *	This project helps to find a parking slot for the vehicles that arrive at the parking lot.
  *	It efficiently tracks and allots the slots for the cars.
## WEAKNESS
  *	During code compilation runtime errors or any other errors can lead to traffic blocks and confusion at the parking spots.
## OPPORTUNITY
  *	The proposed model is less time consuming and hassle free.
  *	Provides necessary guidelines to make parking process smoother altogether.
  *	This project can be operated with minimal man power requirement.
## THREAT
  *	The project would have operational shortcomings in case of power failure.
# 4W's AND 1H's
## WHO
This is used by the staff at the parking lot.
## WHAT
This method is used by the staff of the parking lot to facilitate the vehicles of those individuals who wish to park them.
## WHEN
This method is useful when there is a lot of traffic caused by vehicles waiting for parking slot.
## WHERE
This method can be deployed in places where there are lot of people and they want to park their vehicles such as mall, cinema theatre, hospitals.
## HOW
This program can be executed in a system which has linux or windows operating system.
